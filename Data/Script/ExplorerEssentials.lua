-- hey hi minemaker here
--
-- these are mostly just general functions for specific explorers things, they're not really meant to be used
-- elsewhere but if you want to try and use them for yourself then you can i suppose
--
-- i made this so i wouldn't pull my hair out trying to do everything manually for specific things
-- like special episode team members and stuff like the cutscene bubbles
--
-- so yea that's it bye

function ExplorerEssentials.SpawnBubbles(animID)
	if animID == 1 then
	
	elseif animID == 2 then
	
	elseif animID == 3 then
	
	elseif animID == 4 then
	
	else
		return error(tostring(animID).." is not a valid ID!")
	end
end
