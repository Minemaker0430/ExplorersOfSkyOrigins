A remake of EoS in the PMDO Engine.

This project is in no way affiliated with Nintendo, The Pokemon Company, or Spike Chunsoft. I'm just a fan who likes PMD games.

# Major Changes
 - Treasure Town no longer has a Loading Zone between its two areas.
 - Aura is now based on your favorite color.
 - IQ is completely irrelevant so Spinda's Juice Bar is now used for Major Stat Buffs (NYI)
 - Recruitment now uses Apricorns spawned in valid dungeons. Some dungeons will still not allow recruitment. (NYI)
 - Storage no longer has a limit. (NYI)
 - Electivire's Link Shop now only helps remember moves, due to PMDO not supporting Linked Moves (NYI)
 - Rank Ups now increase the amount of Jobs you can have at once. (NYI)
